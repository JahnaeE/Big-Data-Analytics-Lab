Dominon Voting Project - Dr. Loni Hagen
- How did the  Dominion Voting related misinformation (Fox news originated) propagate through social media? Influential people, information propagation, and impact of organized-online campaigns.

Social Media Addiction - Dr. Fan Yang
- Despite abundant evidence on problematic, excessive social media, current discussions have revealed various challenges in diagnosing social media addiction and that this very notion has been actively rejected by social media users. Utilizing mixed-method, grounded-theory approach combining computational text analysis of social media discussions and in-depth interviews of young adults and senior citizens regarding social media addiction, this study explores how and why users actively reject the concept of “being addicted” to social media despite their heavy dependency on them. A ground theory is proposed to offer a framework for the need to nuance the difference between social media “dependency” and “addiction” in order to better understand the roles of social media in our daily lives.

Multilevel Networks - Dr. Ratna Okhai
- Using two datasets we want to compare Brevard County’s agencies that should have been active per their policy document (CEMP) and ones that were active during Hurricane Irma based on the disaster’s after-action report (AAR) by creating 2 MLNs.
